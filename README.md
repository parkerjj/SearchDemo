Using Swift 4 and Pexels API. 

Pexels API Document :

### Feature
- ##### Search
You can using this App to search&show beautiful photos by type the keyword or tap on suggestion and history.
- ##### History
Every keyword you have successed searched will be storage into history. 
While search input bar expended, you can see the history and easily search history record again just be a simple tap.
- ##### Good UE
I think the most improtant thing on build an App is user experience. 
A good App should have a clear screen and smooth animation on user touch.
And the movement of the next screen should comform to user's expectation.
In this App, I made lots of smooth animation for UE.



### TODO: Something still need to improvement
- ##### Photographer's  Avatar
Pexels isn't support to get the photographer's avatar on his APIs.
But I still leave a blank avatar view on DetailViewController for reserved.
- ##### More Suggestion & Review
Maybe I can get some server and made a backend to log user's search keyword by anonymous.
And on some future version, a page can show the best of the best photo base on user selected.
- ##### More API support
I hope this App may become a unofficial client of Pexels, using their APIs.
- ##### Pure Swift
I used some wheels i write before, using on my privous Application. But they are Objective-C.
ObjC is good, runtime is great. But not very safe. 
Hope I can have some time to convert them into latest Swift.
- ##### Full version of NetworkManager
Improvement of the NetworkManager, Add cache to every request. Then will avoid flood attack to server, and get data respone very quick on duplicated request.
